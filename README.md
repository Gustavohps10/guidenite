# :page_with_curl: Description
<p>
Guidenite is basically a menu that appears on top of other apps. I recently started using the Playnite app, I decided to make my computer interface as similar to a video game interface as possible, so I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating my own menu where I can control it with a gamepad.
